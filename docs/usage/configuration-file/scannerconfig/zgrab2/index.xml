      <description>ZGrab2 integration is experimental and porting is currently not complete. You can help adding modules and improve stability.
 The naming of this module&amp;rsquo;s subscription parameters differ from other ZGrab2 modules due to the need to differentiate between HTTP and HTTPS.
 subscribeHTTPPorts: [&amp;quot;tcp/80&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tcp/8080&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tcp/8000&amp;quot;] Ports to subscribe for HTTP scanning. If one of these is found open, the HTTP scanner module is triggered against that target.
subscribeHTTPSPorts: [&amp;quot;tcp/443&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tcp/8443&amp;quot;] Ports to subscribe for HTTPS scanning.</description>
