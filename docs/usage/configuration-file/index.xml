      <description>TLS If you are running nray in any other than your home network, make sure to enable TLS or you are going to have a bad time! If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what TLS is or don&amp;rsquo;t have a basic understanding of how these parameters play together, you should not run nray over untrusted networks!
 Nray relies on Golang, more specifically mangos, to provide support for TLS 1.2. TLS works with key material created by following the instructions of the TLS quick start guide.</description>
