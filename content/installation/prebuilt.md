Prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from the project's Github page (TODO LINK). Currently, binaries for the following operating systems and architectures are provided:

- Linux: x86, amd64, arm7
- Windows: x86, amd64
- macOS

Since nray is written in Go, you may (*theoretically, untested*) compile it to run on any of [Go's supported operating systems and architectures](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/go/build/syslist.go). 

If you are missing a prebuilt architecture, need to inject your own custom configuration (TODO LINK), just want a build from latest develop or have your own improvements applied, head over to [the documentation on building from source](../build-your-own).
